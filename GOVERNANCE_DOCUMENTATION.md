## 🎁 Reward System

### How Rewards Work

**Participation-Based Rewards**:
- Users earn rewards by participating in governance voting
- The more votes cast and voting power used, the higher the reward allocation
- Rewards are distributed in the Test Token (0xd2b26A7069DaB34c2226cfc416b22fa7C7a33d28)
- Distribution is managed through the Distributor contract

**Reward Cycles**:
- Rewards are distributed in cycles with specific start and end times
- Each cycle tracks total voting weight and number of participants
- Users become eligible for rewards based on their participation level
- Cycle information is tracked and displayed in the user dashboard

**Reward Pool Management**:
- Project funds are injected into the distributor contract
- Total reward pool is divided among eligible participants
- Distribution is proportional to user contribution and voting power
- Real-time tracking of deposited, distributed, and available rewards

### Reward Eligibility

**Requirements**:
- Must have voted on at least one proposal during the reward cycle
- Wallet must hold minimum required token balance
- Must meet participation thresholds set by the contract
- Eligibility is automatically tracked by the smart contract

**Calculation Logic**:
- Voting power × Number of votes × Participation bonus
- Higher token holdings = Higher voting power = Higher rewards
- Consistent participation across multiple proposals increases rewards
- Early participation in proposal voting may receive bonus multipliers

## 📂 Category System

### Category Structure

The governance system organizes proposals into 4 distinct categories:

| Category | Purpose | Examples |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **Category 1** | Protocol Upgrades | Smart contract updates, security improvements |
| **Category 2** | Economic Parameters | Fee structures, reward mechanisms |
| **Category 3** | Governance Changes | Voting procedures, proposal requirements |
| **Category 4** | Community Initiatives | Marketing campaigns, partnerships |

### Category Features

**Independent Operation**:
- Each category operates independently
- Separate lock status for each category
- Category-specific proposal filtering
- Individual category statistics

**Lock System**:
- Admins can lock/unlock categories individually
- Locked categories prevent new voting
- Existing votes remain valid
- Visual indicators show lock status

**Navigation**:
- Tab-based category selection
- Proposal count per category
- Active proposal indicators
- Lock status display

---

## 🗳️ Voting Mechanism

### Voting Power Calculation

**Token-based Weighting**:
- Voting power = Token holdings at proposal snapshot
- Higher token holdings = Greater voting influence
- Snapshot taken at proposal creation
- No delegation system (direct voting only)

### Voting Process

**Technical Flow**:
1. User selects voting option
2. Frontend validates eligibility
3. Smart contract interaction via wagmi
4. Blockchain transaction confirmation
5. Vote recorded immutably
6. Real-time UI updates

**Voting Options**:
- Proposals can have multiple voting options
- Each option tracked separately
- Winning option determined by highest vote weight
- Minimum quorum required for validity

### Quorum System

**Requirements**:
- Minimum participation threshold
- Based on total voting power
- Configurable per proposal
- Visual progress tracking

**Progress Tracking**:
```javascript
const quorumProgress = totalVotes > 0n ?
    Math.min((Number(totalVotes) / Number(quorumAmount)) * 100, 100) : 0;
```
